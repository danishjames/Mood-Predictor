Assume that the `debut` and `finalGame` columns comprise the start and end, respectively, of a player's career. *Hint:* Create a new table from 'Master.csv'. Also note that strings can be converted to dates using the [`DATE`](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Working_with_Dates_and_Times_in_PostgreSQL#WORKING_with_DATETIME.2C_DATE.2C_and_INTERVAL_VALUES) function and can then be subtracted from each other yielding their difference in days.\n",

    "7. What is the effect of table join order on mean salary for the players listed in the main (master) table? *Hint:* Perform two different queries, one that joins on playerID in the salary table and other that joins on the same column in the master table. You will have to use left joins for each since right joins are not currently supported with SQLalchemy."
